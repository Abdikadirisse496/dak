dak is the collection of programs used to maintain the Debian
project's archives.  It's not yet in a state where it can be easily
used by others; if you want something to maintain a small archive and
apt-ftparchive (from apt-utils) is insufficent, I strongly recommend
you investigate mini-dinstall or debarchiver.

If you do insist on trying to try using it, please be careful: katie
sends out lots of emails and if not configured properly will happily
send them to lots of people who probably didn't want those emails.

Don't use katie.conf, apt.conf, cron.* etc. as starting points for
your own configuration files, they're the configuration files for
auric (aka ftp-master.debian.org) and are highly Debian specific.
Start from scratch and refer to the security.debian.org config files
(-security) as they're a better example for a private archive.

NB: don't be put off by the names, see doc/README.names for a mapping
of name -> what the script does.

There are some manpages and READMEs in the doc sub-directory.  The
TODO file is an incomplete list of things needing to be done.

dak is developed and used on Linux but will probably work under any
UNIX since it's almost entirely python and shell scripts.

dak is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
