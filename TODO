To fix
======

More Urgent
-----------

  o katie/jenna/rhona/whatever needs to clear out .changes
    files from p-u when removing stuff superseded by newer versions.

  o maintainers file needs overrides  
 
    [ change override.maintainer to override.maintainer-from +
      override.maintainer-to and have them reference the maintainers
      table.  Then fix charisma to use them and write some scripting
      to handle the Santiago situation. ]

Less Urgent
-----------

 * Harder:

    o REJECT reminders in shania.
    o Clean up DONE; archive to tar file every 2 weeks, update tar tvzf INDEX file.

    o override checks sucks; it needs to track changes made by the
      maintainer and pass them onto ftpmaster instead of warning the
      maintainer.
    o need to do proper rfc822 escaping of from lines (as opposed to s/\.//g)
    o when dinstall is run in install mode but not as a cron job, it
      should probably run jenna to avoid madison originated user confusion
    o Revisit linking of binary->source in install() in katie.
    o Fix component handling in overrides (aj)
    o Fix lack of entires in source overrides (aj)
    o direport misreports things as section 'devel'
    o vrfy check of every Maintainer+Changed-By address; valid for 3 months.
    o binary-all should be done on a per-source, per-architecture package
      basis to avoid, e.g. the perl-modules problem.
    o a source-missing-diff check: if the version has a - in it, and it
      is sourceful, it needs orig and diff, e.g. if someone uploads
      esound_0.2.22-6, and it is sourceful, and there is no diff ->
      REJECT (version has a dash, therefore not debian native.)

 * Easy:
 
    o melanie should behave better with -a and without -b; see
      gcc-defaults removal for an example.
    o Reject on misconfigured kernel-package uploads
    o denise abuses sys.stdout == badly  
    o utils.extract_component_from_section: main/utils -> main/utils, main rather than utils, main
    o Fix katie to remove != stable on stable install, not just f + u
    o Fix katie to warn if run when not in incoming or p-u
    o check for empty debs; check for empty (or small (<1k ?)) .tar.gz's.
    o katie should validate multi-suite uploads; only possible valid one
      is "stable unstable"
    o Don't do override checks for stable only uploads
    o cron.daily* should change umask (aj sucks)
    o Rene doesn't look at debian-installer but should.
    o Rene needs to check for binary-less source packages.
  
 * Bizzare/uncertain:
   
    o validate source consistency, i.e. .dsc and .tar.gz as minimum (??)
    o Rene also doesn't seem to warn about missing binary packages (??)
    o jenna should not delete things because they don't exist (?)
  
 * Cleanups & misc: 
   
    o db_access' get_files needs to use exceptions not this None, > 0, < 0 return val BS (?)
    o The untouchable flag doesn't stop new packages being added to ``untouchable'' suites
    o jenna is too slow
    o jenna doesn't handle arch: any -> arch: all transitions 
      [aj worked around; need to revisit]

TODO
====

More Urgent
-----------

  o testing-updates suite: if binary-only and version << version in
    unstable and source-ver ~= source-ver in testing; then map
    unstable -> testing-updates ?

  o katie needs a stable_reject() which a) removes the package from
    p-u, b) doesn't remove the file from the pool, and c) (optionally, I
    guess) uses a template mail.

  o [Complexish] Secure incoming handling
  o [Hard] dependency checking (esp. stable)
  o Logging
  o Abstraction of suite hardcoding (q.v. progengy)

Packaging
---------

  o Install python libraries (db_access and utils)
  o Install config file
  o Fix stuff to look in sensible places for libs and config file in debian package (?)
  o man pages and/or documentation
  o debian/* assumes arch: all but sql-aptvc.o isn't arch: all.

Less Urgent
-----------

 o fernanda: print_copyright should be a lot more intelligent
     @ handle copyright.gz
     @ handle copyright.ja and copyright
     @ handle (detect at least) symlinks to another package's doc directory
     @ handle and/or fall back on source files?
     @ check only NEW packages out of a source package with some NEW, some old
     @ check latest version if given multiples!

  o To incorporate from utils:
     @ unreject
     @ genreport
     @ reject
     @ newchanges

  o katie could vrfy email addresses (?) [errge@]
  o auto-purge out-of-date stuff from non-free/contrib so that testing and stuff works
  o doogie's binary -> source index
  o ANAIS should be done in katie (?)
  o Add an 'add' ability to melanie (? separate prog maybe)
  o Add urgency + installed date to the DB for aj/testing (? still needed ?)
  o jt's web stuff, matt's changelog stuff (overlap)

  o [Hard] Need to merge non-non-US and non-US DBs. (Need to upgrade to 7.1 for SSL)

  o experimental needs to auto clean (relative to unstable) [warns in rene about this]

  o Do a checkpc(1)-a-like which sanitizes a config files.
  o fix parse_changes()/build_file_list() to sanity check filenames
  o saftey check and/or rename debs so they match what they should be

  o Enable catherine (when daily mirror hit drops down below 300Mb maybe..)
  o Improve andrea.
  o Need to optimize all the queries by using EXAMINE and building some INDEXs.
  o Need to enclose all the setting SQL stuff in transactions (mostly done).
  o Need to finish alyson (a way to sync katie.conf and the DB)
  o Need the ability to rebuild all other tables from dists _or_ pools (in the event of disaster) (?)
  o Make the --help and --version options do stuff for all scripts
  o Need to check for .dsc when source is mentioned

  o charisma can't handle whitespace-only lines (for the moment, this is feature)
  o Should use $EDITOR, not hardcode vi
  o Should reject packages with bad timestamps
  o Replicate old dinstall report stuff (? needed ?)
  o Handle the case of 1:1.1 which would overwrite 1.1 (?)
  o heidi should report suite name not ID [aj]

  o generic way of saying isabinary and isadsc. (?)

  o s/distribution/suite/g

  o cron.weekly:
     @ weekly postins to d-c (?)
     @ backup of report (?)
     @ backup of changes.tgz (?)
