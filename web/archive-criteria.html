	<h1>Rules for existing architectures</h1>

	<ul>
	  <li>If an architecture fails to be included in 2 successive
	  official releases, it is moved out of the official archive (and
	  away from the ftp-master.debian.org host).</li>

	  <li>If a removed architecture later can prove it will be able to
	  make the next official release, it can be re-included into the
	  official archive. This step additionally needs the acceptance of
	  the Security, the Release and the Debian Admin Team. (It needs
	  security autobuilders, porter machines, etc.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Rules for new architectures</h1>
	<ul>
	  <li>A newly included architecture has to be completely built using
	  packages available in plain Debian sources.  External patches cannot
	  be used.<li>

	  <li>At the time of inclusion a minimal set of binary packages will be
	  imported into the archive, just enough to get build-essential ready to
	  go and an official buildd setup and running. Everything else will be
	  rebuilt from scratch. As soon as enough is rebuilt to get the initial
	  toolchain built using "native" Debian, this will be rebuilt too.</li>

	  <li>The packages imported from external source and used for the initial
	  build run must be signed by one of the lead porters, who must be a DD.</li>

	  <li>There must be at least two machines ready to be maintained
	  by the Debian System Administrators, so at the start of its
	  lifetime there will be at least one buildd and one porter machine.</br />

	  The inclusion into the archive will almost certainly happen before
	  the machines are handed over to DSA, but this should happen as
	  soon as feasible afterwards.

	  (Note that this is the minimum to get into the archive. The release team
	  may have additional requirements to allow the architecture to release, so
	  there would normally need to be more machines, especially more buildds.)
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Questions for new architectures</h1>
	<ul>
	  <!-- <li>Is port cursed?</li> -->
	  <li>Are machines available to buy for the general public?</li>
	  <li>Is full source available?</li>
	  <li>Is this architecture related to other architectures already in
	  the archive, or that also should be considered, either now or in
	  the future? Can the related architectures be supported in a single
	  architecture (eg, with a biarch arrangement)?</li>
	  <li>Are there 3 or more developers (or NMs) actively maintaining
	  the port? Who are they?</li>
	  <li>What sort of architecture is this? Desktop/workstation?
	  Mainframe/supercomputer? Embedded? Something else?</li>
	  <li>Does it have any users? If a desktop system, are there Debian
	  admins who run Debian systems on the arch? If an embedded system
	  are there real systems shipping that a Debian port will be useful
	  for? If a mainframe system are there real systems with many users
	  that a Debian port will be useful for? Who are they?</li>
	  <li>Is there kernel and toolchain support? At what level? Are the
	  latest versions supported, or are legacy releases required for
	  compatability with some hardware?</li>
	  <li>Has the ABI stabalised, or are there major ABI changes coming
	  up? Is the ABI stable enough to ensure users will be able just
	  "apt-get dist-upgrade" from one version to the next?</li>
	  <li>How do you install a system? (URL to a HOWTO)</li>
	  <li>Has a buildd been setup? How much of the archive has been
	  built (count by source package, builds of old versions are fine
	  for this case)?</li>
	  <li>What hardware is potentially available as a fast buildd?</li>
	  <li>Is there an example box developers can login to to see if it
	  works?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It's also worth considering whether the port has any special
	requirements. If the port is mainly for embedded systems, it may be
	appropriate to have different installation or release arrangements
	compared to normal desktop/workstation architectures.</p>

	<h1>Further questions for OSes</h1>

	<ul>
	  <li>Are there existing comprehensive free distributions of this OS? If
	  so, why is a Debian distribution useful?</li>
	  <li>What demonstrable benefits does this OS have over existing
	  Debian OSes?</li>
	  <li>Does this system have a standard Unix API?</li>
	  <li>Does the OS support modern glibc and gcc?</li>
	  <li>What is the license on the kernel and core libraries? Is the license
	  free? Is the license GPL compatible? (Note that if it's not free, distributing
	  the software violates the Social Contract; and if it's not GPL compatible,
	  GPL software such as dpkg can't be linked to it)</li>
	  <li>Does the OS build largely without source changes? If so, what proportion of
	  the archive has built?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It's worth thinking about whether it makes sense to integrate the
	port with Debian's Linux-based distribution -- having separate sources
	may not only reduce the impact on the release architectures, but also
	make it easier to do development on the new OS as well.</p>

	<p>Note that if significant changes are needed to more than just a small
	number of packages, your porting team will not only need to provide
	patches for most of those changes and make sure they work, but also
	ensure they don't cause problems for existing ports.</p>
