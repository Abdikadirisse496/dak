# dak - Debian Archive Kit

dak is the collection of programs used to maintain the Debian
project's archives. It is highly optimized for the Debian project,
though can be used by others too.

## More reading
There are some manual pages and READMEs in the [doc](doc) sub-directory.  The
[TODO](doc/TODO) file is an incomplete list of things needing to be done.

There's a mailing list for discussion, development of and help with
dak.  See:

  https://lists.debian.org/debian-dak/

for archives and details on how to subscribe.
