Subject: Missing contents for __PACKAGE__ in accepted queue

While processing the accepted queue, I didn't have contents in the
database for __PACKAGE__ version __VERSION__.  These contents should
have been put into the database by process-unchecked when the package
first arrived.

This is probably stew's fault.
