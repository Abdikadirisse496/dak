This is a collection of patches and fixes/hacks.  The fixes/hacks are
very specific to Debian at the time they were written.  They are
retained here mostly for hysterical raisans and hysetiria's way of
repeating itself, so I don't have to rewrite these disgusting hacks.
Please don't use them, or better yet, even read them.
